##
# Udaeta is a library for managing CAS servers in test environments.  It was
# built for integration testing of the Castanet CAS client library.
#
# It is named after Jos√© de Udaeta (1919-2009), a dancer, choreographer, and
# castanet soloist.  (And, therefore, a man who could really stress
# castanets.)
