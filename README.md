bccasclient
===========

bccasclient (yes, it is awkward to type) is a CAS client library that is
designed to not use any external dependencies.  It was built to eliminate
bcsec's RubyCAS-Client dependency, which was blocking bcsec compatibility with
ActiveSupport 3.0.

bccasclient exports an interface that is compatible with RubyCAS-Client.
