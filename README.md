Castanet: a small, snappy CAS client library
============================================

Castanet is a [CAS 2.0](http://www.jasig.org/cas/protocol) client library.  It
was built at the [Northwestern University Biomedical Informatics
Center](http://www.nucats.northwestern.edu/clinical-research-resources/data-collection-biomedical-informatics-and-nubic/bioinformatics-overview.html)
as a replacement for [RubyCAS-Client](https://github.com/gunark/rubycas-client) in internal software.

Castanet does not support CAS 1.0.

More details to come.
