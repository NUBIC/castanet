bccas-client
============

bccas-client is a CAS client library that is designed to not use any external
dependencies.  It was built to eliminate bcsec's RubyCAS-Client dependency,
which was blocking bcsec compatibility with ActiveSupport 3.0.

bccas-client exports an interface that is compatible with RubyCAS-Client.

bccas-client only implements CAS 2.0.
