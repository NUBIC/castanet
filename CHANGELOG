yyyy-mm-dd (1.1.0)

* Properly handle nil response bodies.
* Test against the Jasig CAS server.
* Users have greater control over the SSL context (#5).  The SSL context hash
  uses the same format as Faraday.
* Castanet::ServiceTicket#retrieve_pgt! now raises Castanet::ProxyTicketError
  if a PGT cannot be retrieved.  (#6)
* Castanet now uses relative URLs to talk to servers, which is more in line
  with expectations of some HTTP servers, i.e. Thin.  (#7)
* Castanet now handles periods in service ticket strings.  This is required by
  the Jasig CAS server; I first saw this behavior in 3.5.0, but it could have
  been introduced earlier.
* All autoload directives removed from Castanet.
* JRuby 1.7 and Rubinius 2.0 preview are now supported.
