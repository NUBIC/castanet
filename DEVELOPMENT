Setting up your development environment
=======================================

To work on Castanet, you'll need Bundler ~> 1.0, RVM, Ragel 6.7, and a Java 6
installation that can compile JSPs.  (If you've got a JDK installed, you're
probably okay to go.)

http://www.complang.org/ragel
https://rvm.io

Once you've got Bundler, RVM, and Ragel installed and set up, install
dependencies.

    $ bundle install

The specs have no external dependencies and can be run directly.

    $ rake spec

The integration tests, however, use a CAS server and proxy callback.  They
default to the Jasig CAS Server:

    $ rake servers:jasig:prep   # Downloads and configures Jasig CAS Server
    $ rake servers:jasig:start &
    $ rake servers:callback:start &
    $ eval `rake servers:jasig:endpoints`
    $ eval `rake servers:callback:endpoints`
    $ rake cucumber:all

You can test against your own CAS server and proxy callback by setting up
appropriate URLs in the test environment:

    $ export CAS_URL=https://localhost:1234/cas
    $ export CALLBACK_URL=https://localhost:1234/callback/receive_pgt
    $ export RETRIEVAL_URL=https://localhost:1234/callback/retrieve_pgt
    $ rake cucumber:all

Finally, there's a task to rebuild the CAS response parsers.

    $ rake fsm:rebuild
