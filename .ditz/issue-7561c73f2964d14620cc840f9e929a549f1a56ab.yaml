title: ProxyTicket#reify! shouldn't return a meaningful value
desc: |-
  The bang-methods on ServiceTicket and ProxyTicket (i.e. methods that mutate a ticket in some irreversible way), with the exception of #reify!, all have a return value that is undefined.  There's no reason why #reify! shouldn't follow that same pattern.
  
  This is an API-breaking change, so it'll be scheduled for 1.0.0.
