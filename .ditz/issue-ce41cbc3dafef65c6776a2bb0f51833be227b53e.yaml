title: Clean up Udaeta
desc: |-
  The Udaeta testing library works, so I'm not really inclined to do this just
  yet, but...well, it's kind of a mess.
  
  Specifically, there's quite a bit of code that can be refactored into reusable
  modules, and there's a lot of classes and methods that need to be documented.
  
  Udaeta's Rake tasks are a mess, too. It'd be nice to eliminate the check/install
  dichotomy and just have a task named, say, udaeta:setup that (1) did everything
  for you and (2) was smart enough to not do what doesn't need doing.
  
  This issue will likely need to be broken apart into multiple issues when (if)
  it's activated.
