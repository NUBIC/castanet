title: Castanet's "HTTPS requirement violated" notice needs to be more descriptive
desc: |-
  If one tries to use Castanet in HTTPS mode to connect to a CAS server that only understands HTTP, an arcane OpenSSL exception is raised.
  
  A more descriptive exception (e.g. "The URL <URL here> specifies HTTP, but Castanet requires HTTPS") would be useful for troubleshooting.
