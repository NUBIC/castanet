title: Extend scenarios to cover usage in mixed HTTP/HTTPS environments
desc: |-
  The patch provided by Rhett Sutphin in {issue fa9f77bec3428954b30315870baa2039b72fb85d} gets mixed HTTP/HTTPS communication working in a NUBIC internal project, but we should provide better assurance that mixed HTTP/HTTPS mode works.
  
  Extend Castanet's scenarios so that each scenario is tested in both a pure HTTPS and mixed HTTP/HTTPS mode.
